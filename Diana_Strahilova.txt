Hello!

My name is Diana Strahilova.

I am a chef by day and a SoftUni student by night.

Currently living in Ireland.

I am hoping to learn more skills in programming with SoftUni to change careers. Besides Python, I have experience with HTMl, CSS, JavaScript
and Django framework, which I am really interested in.

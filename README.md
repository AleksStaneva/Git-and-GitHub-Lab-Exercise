TAST DESCRIPTION AS INDICATED IN THE GIT AND GIT HUB LAB FILE:

•	Commit the new file to your local repository.
•	Sync the changes to upload your file to the remote repo.
•	Browse the repo from https://github.com/user/repo to check whether your file has been successfully uploaded to GitHub.

3.	Create a Git Conflict & Merge
•	All team members create a common file, "config.txt".
•	Each team member adds some settings in "config.txt", e.g.:
  o	name = Peter
  o	size = 100
  o	email = peter@dir.bg
•	Each team member commits his local changes.
•	Each team member syncs his changes:
  o	The first member will succeed without conflicts.
  o	The others will have a conflict to be merged.
  o	Resolve the conflict:
	Edit the merged changes + commit and sync again.

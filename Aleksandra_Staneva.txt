Hello!
My name is Aleksandra Staneva.

I'm currently a Technical Support Engineer for Microsoft 365, and I'm also a student at SoftUni, where Iâ€™m building my skills in programming.

As a passionate reader, I run a book club called Game of Tomes and aspire to create a dedicated website for it in the future.
